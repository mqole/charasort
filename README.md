<sub>unsourced. Not to be confused with <a href="https://snksorter-blog.tumblr.com/">snksorter-blog</a>, created before Aug 19 2013. that one credits bathkame though.</sub><br>
<sub>unsure if blog authors are the same, probably not? source code different (variable BattleNo changed to QuestionNo, etc.) but the dates updated/created are very similar. could be plagarism. could be the same author redoing the code. no clue</sub>
